minimal X environment for caffeine linux.

what is the difference from the minimal X environment and the KDE env.
    not much, the minimal X environment will be targeted toward people that 
    A) want to use their own DE B) have hardware unable to run KDE well
    C) love DWM                 D) hate KDE

How does it change the default installed software
    by default the image will come with dwm+other suckless tools, firefox and
    terminator. 

why?
    I personally don't use KDE, but I felt that it be the best DE for the job
    of a actually usable linux, This version is more what i want out of my
    distro to be and i hope that people actually enjoy it.
